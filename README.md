# Python-Chat-Application
Python GUI chatRoom

I have created one Server and multiple clients on a chat room using TCP based connection over UDP.
As we know the consistency matters in chat Applications over availability as some data packets will be lost, while transferring.
Here I have used the threading concept also for chatRoom efficiency.
Sockets is used for efficient connection over predefined port number and prescribed ip address.
